These text snippets were generated by fake_news.py using almost default parameters.
The only difference was that the model was trained on words, not characters. 
But the RNN architecture, n_outputs, etc., was the same, as were training parameters.

I have also experimented with different model parameters using a character-based RNN,
but none of those generated text as good as what's below. I was hoping to use what I'd
learned from character-based RNN learning to train a "smarter" word-based RNN, but
all of the GPUs were busy until late Wed. night. On Thurs. morning, Prof. Lafferty sent a note asking us
not to try to submit any more jobs to the GPUs if we've generated any text so far,
so I didn't try to submit more jobs.

Quick learnings from character-based RNNs: even short epochs (30-50) and incomplete seem to give 
word-like representations, even if it's trained on an incomplete corpus! The first
few epochs are garbled sequences of characters, but after a while, the punctuation
symbols become separated from the alpha characters in a sensible way and the spaces
become placed in reasonable places. Finally, for a character-based RNN 
with a large numebr of nodes and connections and trained on
a large corpus, the RNN generates almost always correct words. Sometimes, howver,
it generates sequences of characters that are similar to real words, but aren't 
actually real words.

Quick comments on the word-RNN outut below: some of the sentences are really 
grammatical. It's very impressive! Becuase this RNN was trained on the business corpus,
it's very good at generating syntactically-meaningful text for a lot of commonly-used
business phrases. E.g., ones describing how stocks or indeces rose or fell. A great
example is in the first text below: "u.s. auto sales trading is up 1.2% to $2.24 billion, compared with 20 per cent in april." Cool or creepy? Not sure.
